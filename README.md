The PhonePe Pulse Dashboard is a comprehensive solution that aims to extract, transform, and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The objective is to provide users with an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that presents valuable insights and information in a user-friendly manner.

The solution follows a systematic approach, starting with the extraction of data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. Using scripting, the repository is cloned, and the data is fetched and stored in JSON format.

Next, the data is transformed using Python and library Pandas. This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis and visualization. The transformed data is then inserted into a MySQL database using the "SQLAlchemy" library, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

To create the interactive dashboard, Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python are used. The dashboard is designed to display the data in a visually appealing manner, with various charts, graphs, and maps.

The data retrieval process involves connecting to the MySQL database and fetching the required data into a Pandas dataframe. This data is then used to update the dashboard dynamically, ensuring that users have access to the latest insights and information.

The dashboard offers a range of dropdown options, providing users with flexibility in selecting different facts and figures to display. Users can customize the dashboard to focus on specific metrics or statistics of interest.

The deployment of the dashboard makes it easily accessible to users, enabling them to explore and gain valuable insights from the PhonePe Pulse data.

In conclusion, the PhonePe Pulse Dashboard is a comprehensive solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. By following a structured approach and leveraging Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, the solution provides users with an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that facilitates data exploration, analysis, and insights discovery.
